# QMK Compiler Keyboard Suppport

By default the template that QMK Compiler has is very limited. You can only specify a keymap and can not reference macros or custom keys. QMK Compiler lets you specify information about your keyboard so that configurator apps can make use of them.

# Keyboard Metadata

To aid Web and GUI programs that wish to use this API we are publishing metadata about keyboards. You can use this metadata to get information about the keyboard like Manufacturer, Product and Vendor ID's, Processor, and more. This data is populated from the [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) repository.
